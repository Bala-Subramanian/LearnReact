About the application
Assignment 1:
The application will have a header with the app name on the top left 
and the navigation menus on the Right side.

I have added a sub heading which will display the screen name and I used "useLocation()" for this.

All the component for this assignment are saved under Component folder inside the src folder.

To redirect to pages, i have used Route and Link.
All the invalid URL's will land on Error component, which has a button for redirecting to home.

In order to navigate to home from contact us and error page, I used "useNavigate()"


Creation of Blog component:
    To save the value passed a postId, I used useParams().
    Added an extra condition, where a different message will be displayed if the postId = 0

Assignment 2:
    In the login page, if we pass "admin" as username and password, and click on Handle Auth button, 
    a div will be displayed.

    For this, I have created a folder named HOC and the relevant values are in it.
